Dear {{ speaker.first_name }},

Unfortunately, your talk has not been chosen for WebCamp Zagreb this year.

The competition has been tough and there have been almost twice as many application then the previous year, so don't feel bad.

We appreciate your application and hope that you'll apply again next year. Thank you for making WebCamp Zagreb possible.

Best regards,

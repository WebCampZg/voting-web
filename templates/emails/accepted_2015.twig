Dear {{ speaker.first_name }},

Congratulations, your talk "{{ talk.title }}" has been chosen for WebCamp Zagreb 2015.

Please confirm that you're able to appear on stage this October and we will announce your talk later this week.

Since our speaker package includes accommodation for speakers outside of the Zagreb area, please tell us if you will be needing it so we can book you a room.

I will be your contact leading up to the conference, so feel free to ask me any questions you may have. There will be an email with general instructions for speakers sent at a later date.

Please take this time to double-check your biography and abstract and make any adjustments needed since this will be displayed to the public soon.
